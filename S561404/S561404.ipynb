    "Base reference found (https://pynative.com/print-pattern-python-examples/). This code is complex and uses 3 separate loops to create the structure. k is used for 2 * rows - 2, with 5 rows as dictated by the variable rows. This is where the spaces printed before the stars is determined. \n",
    " \n",
    " * Loop i OUTER MOST LOOP: Creates the range of numbers from rows to -1, which generates each rows of the pattern as the triangle is inverted. \n",
    "* Loop j FIRST INNER LOOP: This loop iterates over a range of numbers from k to 0. It's used to print the spaces BEFORE the * of each row. \n",
    "*  Loop j SECOND INNER LOOP: Establishes the range of numbers from 0 to i + 1, and when combined with the outer Loop for j, it creates a star followed by a space without changing lines.\n",

    "# Solution Code to 10:\n",
    "This code is simpler, as it uses fewer loops, the reason being that we can use the conditional statement 'if/else'. By using this particular iteration, we don't have to use as many loops but rather specific formulas instead. While using loops can be interesting, I decided the use of the nested loops wasn't as clean as using an 'if/else' statement. \n",
    "\n",
    "The pattern has 5 rows, the bottom contains 8 * and is based on a specific pattern. The 'if' statement creates the loop with the condition being that 'i < 4' to generate rows 1 - 3. The first 3 rows use a string concatenation, meaning that i is for the number of times * is used, the space is created using '2 * i'. The concatenation allows for us to string together the two different strings using + as we are creating essentially a structured string. \n",
